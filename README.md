Can polytopes be represented without resort to vectors? A polytope as a graph of facets fails to capture convexity, so a different representation is required. See http://www.sidegeo.blogspot.com/ for my understanding of the relevant math. In particular, note that a polytope can be embedded in a finite space, and any finite space with a property I call "linear" can be converted to numeric planes. These operations implemented here can form the kernel of applications for graphically exploring 2 or 3 dimensional objects, and for symbolically exploring spaces of more dimensions than 3.
